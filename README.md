# Fractional calculator

## How to use


Make executable the `fractional_calculator.rb`

```sh
chmod +x bin/fractional_calculator.rb
```

Now you can run the script by this command:

```sh
./bin/fractional_calculator.rb
```

## One Identity Coding Challenge

Thank you for taking the One Identity coding challenge! You may use any coding language. Please
provide the solution via a GitHub repository (preferred) or a zip file. The time spent does not need to
be reported, but we would appreciate having the exercise returned within 7 days. We will review the
solution and may elect to discuss it during any follow-up interviews.

Code will be evaluated on these criteria:
- The solution builds and runs. Instructions are helpful.
- The program gives the correct answers.
- Errors are handled and reported.
- The code is well structured and can be readily understood.
- The code has been tested and includes evidence of such (hint: unit tests).

### The Problem

Write a command-line program that takes operations on fractions as input and produces a fractional
result.
- The command-line program shall repeatedly prompt the user for input and display the result
until user types "exit".
- Legal operators shall be *, /, +, - (multiply, divide, add, subtract).
- Operands and operators shall be separated by one or more spaces.
- Mixed numbers shall be represented by whole&numerator/denominator; for example "3&1/4", "-1&7/8".
- Improper fractions, whole numbers, and negative numbers are allowed as operands.

Example runs (where '?' represents the command prompt):

? 1/2 * 3&3/4

= 1&7/8

? 2&3/8 + 9/8

= 3&1/2

? 1&3/4 - 2

= -1/4
